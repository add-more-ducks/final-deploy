## Thomas van Genderen - Spring 2021

# 15 April 
I handed in my Design doc yesterday. 
Today I will try to contact the TA's again.

- The choice youâ€™ve made
- What you expect to happen as a result of that choice (at this moment in time)
- Why you expect things to pan out that way

# 19 April

Need to decide what I add to increase the complexity and depth to my design doc.
- No decision has yet been taken. Tomorrow I will try again.
- Some unneccessary elements have been trimmed from the design document.

# 20 April

- Started adding new ideas to the design of the application.
-   User input for items
-   Admin validation of users.
This solves the problem of data extraction from wikipedia as it can be easily interpreted by users.

# 21 April
- I chose to give the admin his own page from which most of the site-maintenance controls are accessible.

# 22 April
I am faced with the choice of what to with the .csv file. The TimelineJS site advices to use google spreadsheets. I have found a possible way to forgo that external file and use a local .csv file. source: https://framagit.org/eduinfo/timelinejs-local/-/tree/master/public
