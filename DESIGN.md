## Lists

Include a couple of lists that are more detailed than in your proposal document:

a list of APIs and frameworks or plugins that you will be using to provide functionality in your app (and explain exactly what features youâ€™re using them for)

a list of data sources if you will get data from an external source, including information on how your are going to filter and transform the data for your project, with examples of raw data and the actual data you need


Scraped from Wikipedia will be an URL, picture, summary, dates, names, and possibly more with the use of __BeautifulSoup4__

The database will be created and interacted with with the use of __SQLAlchemy__

The tool for the JS interactive timeline will be __TimelineJS__

__pandas__ is probably needed for the data analysis.

__LXML__ as a parser.

__Google spreadsheet__ will be one of the main data repositories in a csv format.
